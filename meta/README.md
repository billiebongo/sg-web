# About

This is a directory of the Singapore-related Internet.

The problem this project seeks to address is that there is so much content on the modern Internet that it can be difficult to find what you're looking for and it can be difficult to discover new content.

To find something using a search engine, you usually have to know that it exists and use the right language. Recommendation systems do help you find things you don't know about, but they base their recommendations on their observations of your behaviour. Consequently, they tend to recommend things not very different from whatever you've recently been looking at and whatever is likely to keep you on the relevant platform the longest. This may not always be what you want or what is best for you.

It can also be difficult to get an idea of what the Singapore Internet looks like from just individual sites and search engine results.

Hopefully, this project will allow you to:

- Marvel at the size and diversity of the Singapore Internet
- Find things you know exist but haven't been able to find again
- Discover new sites or entirely new sections of the ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ internet that you hadn't known about before
