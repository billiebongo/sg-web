## Guidelines

### Update the TOC

If you're updating headers, do also remember to update the Table of Contents. You can use [github-markdown-toc](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc) or just edit the markdown manually.

### Include a description

Use the following format for new sites:

```markdown

- [site name](https://example.com) - short, neutral description of site

```

The description is optional.

### Make sure it's related to Singapore

There must be a significant connection between the site and Singapore.

Examples of situations where the criteria is fulfilled:

- The only author is Singaporean, or is resident in Singapore
- A large proportion of the content is about Singapore

Examples of situations where the criteria is not fulfilled

- Only one, or a small proportion of the many authors is Singaporean
- The site is hosted in Singapore but there is otherwise no other connection to Singapore
- The site has a `.sg` top-level domain but there is otherwise no other connection to Singapore

### Ordering

Items should generally be in alphabetical order unless there is a good reason to order them differently. One such good reason is that a site is no longer functional or has otherwise shuttered, in which case it should be put below sites that are still functioning.

### Notability

There are no notability requirements.

### Use the relevant symbols

- ‚ò† for sites that are no longer working or which have been abandoned or appear to be abandoned.
- üèõÔ∏è for government sites (sites operated by government-linked companies, e.g. Singtel do not count)
